Playful Sparkle - Product to Category Filter

The Playful Sparkle - Product to Category Filter extension enhances your OpenCart 4.x store by simplifying filter management within categories. Upon saving product information, this extension automatically links associated product filters to the relevant categories, saving time and ensuring consistency across your filter setup.

A key feature of this extension is the ability to remove unused filters from categories. In each category's Data > Filters section, simply click the blue Remove unused filters button to clear out filters that are no longer relevant. This reduces frontend processing, as the system no longer needs to check product associations for filters that aren’t in use. The result is improved page load times, creating a more efficient and streamlined browsing experience for your customers.

With the Playful Sparkle - Product to Category Filter extension, you’ll gain an effective way to enhance filter management and optimize your store’s performance, freeing you up to focus on business growth.
